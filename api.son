He invented several unique techniques under the Temenos umbrella (Influence Maps, Supplication, Exit &amp; Re-entry, Language of Elegance, The Interview, Clean Slate, Cereal Box, Intensive Collaboration &amp; Discovery) that are now used for managing strategic plans and scaling operations/projects at various client locations. Siraj is also an expert/student of Systems Thinking, Learning Organizations, People Dynamics, Transactional Analysis, MBTI, FIRO(B), Element B, Leadership &amp; Motivation and Team Building. He hosts and facilitates the annual STIA+Temenos Conferences. Siraj completed his MBA in 1992 and he continues to learn every second! He loves poetry, travel, music, books and being with people. He brings tremendous energy and passion to every engagement (woo hoo!). Room Setup: Rounds Duration:[masked] minutes Keywords: change, Agile, Executives, SAFe, Enterprise, Transformation, Agility, Leaders, enterprise agile, scaled agile framework, Change-Management, containeering Abstract: \"No snowflake in an avalanche ever feels responsible\" - Voltaire Enterprise Agile Transformation initiatives are BIG. Change at this scale of thousands is tough. The Leaders, Executives and Internal Change Agents involved in these initiatives are going through their own personal transformation. Change at this scale of one is equally tough. The heart of enterprise agile that is transforming beats with the hearts of all the leaders, executives and internal change agents going through their own personal transformation. In working with hundreds of executives leading and internal change agents enabling the enterprise agile transformation initiatives, we have seen how the enterprise transformation happens when they bring their heart to the change initiative. These are their stories of personal growth and individuation. We will hear how transformation at a personal level is the leverage for transformation at a collective level. We will also learn of unique methods that activate personal transformation for leaders and change agents who are ready to step into their leader/change agent persona but are unable to get that from the current leadership offerings available in their context. Session Agenda: The delivery approach will be one of story telling with highly evocative visuals of actual case studies and enterprise agile transformation in action. I hope to engage the audience with these stories and make them ask questions during the session … and continue to ponder on these stories after the session. My intention is to empower leaders and change agents in the audience and call on them to take their game to the next level of bringing their heart to the game! The[masked] min session will flow like this: 10 min - Introduction, About Us, Experience with Enterprise Agility and Leadership / Internal Change Agent Transformation @ Fortune 500 clients 10 min - Why is Enterprise Agile Transformation Hard? Why is Personal Transformation Hard? 10 min - How do we see the Heart of the Enterprise Agile Transformation in the hearts of the Leaders and Internal Change Agents? 15 min - Who are these Leaders and Internal Change Agents? What is their \"Change Agentry style\"? How do we enable them to be more successful and avoid self sabotage in an enterprise that is waiting for them to fail? 15 min (to 60 min)-- Case Studies &amp; Exercises (It’s My Fault, I Don’t Know, Personal Vision) 10 min (to 60 min) - Exercise - How do we Approach the Heart of the Transforming Enterprise? 5 min (to 20 min)- Q&amp;A Prerequisite Knowledge: basic knowledge of enterprise agile and leadership transformation and challenges bonus: working with leaders / change agents in an enterprise agile transformation and seeing them go thru the change Learning Outcomes: Find the heart of enterprise agile transformation in our selves. Deconstruct the invisible and tacit link between Enterprise Agile transformation and Leadership transformation challenges Enable leaders and change agents to bring their heart in their own context Provide tools and techniques to make this easier Presentation History: I have presented an earlier version of this topic before at Agile NZ 2015 (Sep 2015) and at several meet ups in USA, India and New Zealand. I am also presenting this at Agile India 2016 (March 2016).

Agenda 1. ReactJS with Django Abstract: ReactJS is an amazing new front-end framework developed by Facebook. Unfortunately, if you are new to JavaScript it is quite hard to setup and even harder to integrate with Django. Martin will demonstrate all necessary steps to implement and deploy your first little React components and hook them up with your existing Django website. The beauty of this approach is, that you can start with very small components and \"reactify\" your existing site in small steps, one component at a time, no big project migration is needed. Speaker: Martin Brochhaus \nMartin has been creating web applications for more than 15 years using various programming languages along the way. In 2010 he discovered the Python programming language and immediately fell in love. In Singapore he founded the web development agency \"Bitmazk Pte Ltd\" and has since helped various clients and startups around the globe to get off the ground using modules and frameworks from Python's rich ecosystem. Martin is an open source enthusiast with more than 150 repositories on GitHub and a very active member of the local Python User Group Singapore. He has been on the organizing committee of PyCon Singapore for the past three years and is currently fostering PyLadies Singapore to help more women to get into software development. 2. TDD with pytest Abstract: Learning TDD practice in Python can be challenging because there are several \"competing\" packages without an obvious \"best way\" to do it. Simplicity and readability arecore concepts in Python. In this talk I will try to show how it can be applied to testing by doing a side-by-side comparison of unittest/selenium vs pytest/splinter in a simple web application development context. \n\nSpeaker:  Ivan Zimine Ivan earned his PhD in Physics in 2003 from University of Geneva, Switzerland.He spent 13 years doing academic research in medical physics, but then decidedthat he really preferred writing software to scientific papers, and moved to ITfield.

We going to have meetup and talk about Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template scripts. It will be #LSFD (less slides, full demos) meetup. This is for beginners (not just for Azure beginners) who don't understand how to create Cloud Infrastructure by just using a simple JSON text file. No, it's not Powershell file, no coding scripts. It's just a JSON text file. This text file can than be executed in Azure Resource Manager. Here is what you will get from the talk: 1. Understand what is ARM and what is Template Scripts, what is JSON (for those who don't know). 2. Understand how to create a simple implicit VM using ARM scripts and execute in Azure. Update the scripts and automate it. 3. Translate (interpret) an architectural design and generate the Scripts. 4. Creating more complex design such as multiple VMs with Virtual Network, Load Balancers, MySql, DocumentDB, App Services, etc. 5. Accessing ARM through API using .NET (as an example). 5. And lots of Live Demos. So, basically ARM template scripts is like your cloud infrastructure meta data file (blueprint file) that can be edited/saved and reuse or for automation. \n\n\nSPEAKER Azure Cloud Expert Juv Chan (Chan Kae Siang). He Studied Computer Engineering at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore back in 2004. \n\n\nSeriously, this will be tons of new knowledge for beginners and you don't want to miss this topic.
